At Artoo, we have never had a full fledged QA role and now in retrospect really appreciate the value and experience of a good QA. We have a jungle and don't know where to start. We are proud devs who want an equally proud QA who can join our band of geeks. We want the kind of QA who understands the product, the user and the environment and comes up with a plan that ensures we succeed on every parameter regardless of these three dimensions. We want the QA who puts devs in their place. The kind well defined <a href="https://www.thoughtworks.com/insights/blog/qa-role-what-it-really">by this article</a>.

We work with Ember on the frontend and Native android on mobile. Since our apps are tied to enterprises ("secretive stuff") we picked out LinkedIn as the consumer product to show-off your charms. The test plan is common but with 2 sets of test cases, one each for web and mobile.

So, for the purpose of the interview your task is to *write a test plan* and *implement test cases* using tools you are comfortable with. Can you to lay out and test at least 2 user flows, decipher differences (if any) between web and mobile versions. To get started we suggest a few (you can pick other interesting user flows too),
 * User signup / login
 * Edit user's extended profile (education, job experiences, extra curriculars, etc..) 
 * Explore and connect with new `related` people

Several aspects of a modern consumer facing service are important. Usability, Performance, Security, Localization are a few that immediately spring to mind. Does your test plan and the resulting cases address these and others?

Remember we are going to evaluate you on the following parameters:
 * How you code - structure, comments, and efficiency
 * How well are you able to understand the product inside out
 * How you think and how creative you are
 * How quickly can you learn
 * Product areas are you an expert on - usability, performance, security, low resources (connectivity, memory,..) etc..

Feel free to ask lots of questions, bring curiousity and creativity to the endeavour.

If you are going for the kill and you really want to wow us:

1. Think about a low literate user and make recommendations on how you will improve the UI/UX.
2. Think about low connectivity (2G, half a G) or low end phones (1GB RAM with 50 apps), show us how will you improve the application.
3. What are the possible security issues, how to set up processes to track and fix those.

### Final Words
When you are done, please just create a pull request on this repo. We would like you to come in and present your code to the whole team. 

May the force be with you!
