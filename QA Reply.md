At Artoo, we have never had QAs and now in retrospective really appreciate the value and experience of a good QA. We have a jungle and don't know where to start. We are proud devs who want an equally proud QA who can join our band of geeks. We want the kind of QA who understands the product, the user and the environment and comes up with a plan that ensures we succeed on every parameter regardless of these three dimensions. We want the QA who puts devs in their place.

Your task is to write a test plan and implement a few of the test cases that prove you are the above kind of QA. Remember we are going to evaluate you on the following parameters:
 * How you think and how creative you are
 * How you code - structure, comments, and efficiency
 * And how quickly can you learn

Since our apps are tied to enterprises ("secretive stuff"), we picked out Zomato for you. Here are a few points to get you started below. Be creative in your approach.

* Zomato Mobile App
* Zomato Web App
* Zomato API

If you are going for the kill and you really want to wow us:

1. Think about a low literate user and make recommendations on how you will improve the UI/UX
2. Think about low connectivity and show us how will you improve the application

### Final Words
When you are done, please just create a pull request on this repo. We would like you to come in and present your code to the whole team. 

May the force be with you!
